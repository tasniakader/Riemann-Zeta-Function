# The Riemann Zeta Function

This project explores the Riemann zeta function, one of the most important functions in complex analysis. In his 1859 paper 'On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude,' Bernhard Riemann aimed to understand how prime numbers are distributed. To approach this, he extended the definition of the zeta function to complex numbers, provided an analytic continuation of the function, explored several of its key properties, and even outlined a strategy for proving the Prime Number Theorem.

This paper discusses many of the ideas presented in Riemannâ€™s original work. It provides an overview of its definition, analytic continuation, and key properties, including its zeros. It also discusses the Basel problem and evaluates the function at -1.
This paper was submitted as part of the coursework for Real and Complex Analysis II at Temple University in Spring 2025.
