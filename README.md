# The Riemann Zeta Function

This project explores the Riemann zeta function, one of the most important functions in complex analysis. The paper provides an overview of its definition, analytic continuation, and key properties, including its zeros. It also discusses the Basel problem and evaluates the function at -1.
This paper was submitted as part of the coursework for Real and Complex Analysis II at Temple University in Spring 2025.
